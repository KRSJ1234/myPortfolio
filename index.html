                            At my second home, I left the comfort of my home at the age of 10. These transformative years turned me from a timid, studious, and slightly chubby kid into a confident, fit, and adventurous young man. Alongside immersing myself in basketball, volleyball, and taking on art direction for dramas and skits, I also started loving books. Additionally, I embraced National Cadet Corps (NCC) training for discipline and leadership. Graduating as 'The Best Outgoing Student, Class of 2015' stands as my proudest achievement.

                        <div>The 'Engineering the Eye Hackathon' represents a dynamic, five-day event collaboratively organized by prominent organizations: Microsoft, Carl Zeiss, the LV Prasad Eye Institute, the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, and the Indian Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad. Renowned as one of India's largest and most esteemed hackathons, the event stands out due to its extensive participant engagement. The hackathon centers around addressing real-world challenges encountered in the fields of Ophthalmology and Optometry, impacting both medical professionals and patients. Our specific problem statement was developed through comprehensive discussions with several doctors from the LV Prasad Eye Institute, ensuring its relevance and potential impact.</div>

                        <div>
                            Duane's Retraction Syndrome is a condition present from birth that affects eye movement. It's marked by limited sideways eye movement, and the eye area (palpebral fissure) narrows when trying to move the eyes inward. Sometimes, when attempting this inward movement, the eye might also move up or down unexpectedly.

Experts rely on physical measuring tools and subsequent calculations to determine accurate measurements, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error.</li>
                                <li><span><strong>Risk of Infection</strong>:</span> There have been instances, as highlighted by a doctor we consulted, where patients contracted infections due to the use of non-sterile physical measurement devices during the assessment process.</li>
                                <li><span><strong>Lack of Live Measurement in Surgery</strong>:</span> In the context of corrective surgeries or treatments for eye conditions, there is no system in place for the live measurement of the degree of deviation from the normative eye alignment. This absence of real-time data can impact the precision and effectiveness of these medical interventions.</li>

                        <div>
                            In addressing Duane's Retraction Syndrome (DRS), we encountered the challenge of establishing a measurable standard for deviation from the norm. Most doctors rely on experience for assessment, as a widely recognized standard isn't yet in common use. Although a standard by Dr. Kekunnaya and colleagues exists, it hasn't been universally adopted. After consulting with four doctors at our institute, we decided to implement the methodology proposed in Dr. Kekunnaya's paper.
                        </div>
                        <a href="https://hyderabadeyeresear-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/prashanthr_lvpei_net/EY01zuLgWw9Gk2MncIsi2MQBh-sL0-cA-JOeQGCfT2oowg?e=LYBbgU" class="paper" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Projects/eye-fi/kekunaya_paper.png" alt="a screenshot of a research paper" class="research-paper"></a>
                        <div>Once we fixed on the algorithm to use to determine the degree of DRS, we spent time brainstorming about various methods to get measurements</div>
                        <div>Each of us were experimenting on various approaches. We tried following approaches</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span><strong>Deep Learning-Based Point Detection</strong>:</span> Utilize a deep learning approach to identify key facial points (such as the top and bottom of the eyelid, center of the pupil, etc.). These coordinates can then be used to calculate the necessary distances.</li>
                            <li><span><strong>Computer Vision Approach</strong>:</span> Implement a method that involves converting the image to grayscale and employing Harr-Cascade classifiers and blob detection techniques to locate the iris. Subsequent adjustments to the program would enable distance measurements.</li>
                            <li><span><strong>Exploring Pre-Existing Models</strong>:</span> Conduct a thorough search for existing models that may be adapted or integrated into our solution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>We quickly ruled out the deep learning solution due to a lack of sufficient data and resources necessary for training an effective model. Our initial attempts with a computer vision-based approach yielded moderate success. However, this method had to be ultimately set aside as the accuracy of the results was significantly impacted by variables such as lighting conditions and the positioning of the subject in the image. A pivotal moment came when we engaged in a discussion with a senior Microsoft engineer present at the venue, who introduced us to the Microsoft Azure Face API.</div>
                        <div>The Microsoft Azure Face API demonstrated remarkable proficiency in detecting major landmarks on various face images. Through extensive experimentation with a diverse array of images, we achieved a notably high success rate, underscoring the robustness and reliability of the API.</div>

                        </div>
                        <div>An advantageous aspect of our approach was leveraging Kekunnaya's algorithm, which primarily relies on calculating ratios. This meant that calibration issues, often a concern in such applications, did not affect our results, significantly enhancing the reliability of our method.</div>
                        <div>Our mentor highlighted a critical concern: ensuring data security against potential breaches. This is especially paramount given that the iris constitutes a biometric signature, and the leakage of such sensitive images could lead to significant ramifications. To address this issue, we opted to integrate the Zeiss Visuhealth API, renowned for its secure and accurate transmission of ocular images over the Internet, facilitating communication between doctors and patients. Consequently, our final architecture incorporated this API as a key component to ensure enhanced data security.</div>

                        <div>
                            TJ Distributors, co-founded by <strong>Mr. Joseph Mathew</strong> and <strong>Mr. Tenson M Jacob</strong>, 
                            marks a new chapter in the realm of distribution, specifically in the steel and aluminum utensils sector. 
                            This venture, rooted in a rich heritage, commenced as a bold step by these two industry veterans. Both founders, 
                            previously key figures at Anna Aluminium Company—a titan in aluminum utensil manufacturing—decided to embark 
                            on their entrepreneurial journey after dedicating three decades to their former employer.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            The company originated in Ernakulam, Kerala, with a modest customer base of just 10 businesses. Remarkably, 
                            over the past two years, TJ Distributors has witnessed a meteoric rise, now proudly catering to over 500 small 
                            businesses across the region. This growth trajectory not only reflects the founders' deep industry knowledge but 
                            also their unwavering commitment to quality and service.
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            What sets TJ Distributors apart is its extensive product range, featuring over 200 brands from diverse regions 
                            of India. This wide assortment underlines the company's dedication to offering variety and quality to its clientele. 
                            As the son of Mr. Joseph Mathew, I have had the unique opportunity to witness and be a part of this entrepreneurial 
                            success story, observing firsthand the resilience and strategic acumen that have been the cornerstone of TJ Distributors' 
                            impressive expansion.

                        <div>During my free time, I often engaged in small-scale branding projects for friends. Given my connection as Joseph's son, it was natural for me to be the go-to person for the branding of TJ</div>

                            Coming up with 'TJ Distributors' was a piece of cake, honestly. It was one of those lazy, no-sweat tasks. I just had a quick look at what other similar businesses were named, and bam – 'TJ Distributors' was born before my coffee got cold. 'TJ'? That's just a chill nod to the first names of our laid-back founders, Mr. Tenson and Mr. Joseph. As for 'Distributors', well, it's just them being super straightforward about what they do.

                        <div>
                            Crafting the logo for TJ Distributors was like stepping into the big leagues – my first high-visibility project and, yep, no pressure, but it's for my dad. So, here's how I roll with my branding magic:
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, I turn into a detective, gathering every snippet of info about the company, from the founders' breakfast choices to their grand vision.</li>
                            <li>Next, a chinwag with the big guns – do they have a style or color preference? Maybe a secret love for neon green?</li>
                            <li>Then, it's market study time – what's going to make our target audience's heads turn?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>These steps? They're my treasure map for inspiration. And here's what my treasure hunt uncovered:</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The founders are fans of the 'keep-it-simple' club. They want a logo that’s like a perfect espresso – small, but packs a punch.</li>
                            <li>Adding the name, founding year, or a tagline to the logo? They left that ball in my court.</li>
                            <li>A rainbow of colors? Nope, they prefer to keep the color palette more minimalist than a zen garden.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>
                            Armed with this goldmine of info, the brainstorming storm began. My weapon of choice? Good ol' pen and paper for sketching out those initial bursts of genius. If a doodle catches my eye, it gets the VIP treatment – refined, polished, and transformed into digital art using Adobe Illustrator.
