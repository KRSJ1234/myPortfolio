                            At my second home, I left the comfort of my home at the age of 10. These transformative years turned me from a timid, studious, and slightly chubby kid into a confident, fit, and adventurous young man. Alongside immersing myself in basketball, volleyball, and taking on art direction for dramas and skits, I also started loving books. Additionally, I embraced National Cadet Corps (NCC) training for discipline and leadership. Graduating as 'The Best Outgoing Student, Class of 2015' stands as my proudest achievement.

                        <div>
                            Duane's Retraction Syndrome is a condition present from birth that affects eye movement. It's marked by limited sideways eye movement, and the eye area (palpebral fissure) narrows when trying to move the eyes inward. Sometimes, when attempting this inward movement, the eye might also move up or down unexpectedly.

                                <li><span><strong>Manual Measurement of DRS</strong>:</span> Currently, the measurement of Duane's Retraction Syndrome (DRS) is a manual process. Experts rely on physical measuring tools and subsequent calculations to determine accurate measurements, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error.</li>
                                <li><span><strong>Risk of Infection</strong>:</span> There have been instances, as highlighted by a doctor we consulted, where patients contracted infections due to the use of non-sterile physical measurement devices during the assessment process.</li>

                        <div>
                            In addressing Duane's Retraction Syndrome (DRS), we encountered the challenge of establishing a measurable standard for deviation from the norm. Most doctors rely on experience for assessment, as a widely recognized standard isn't yet in common use. Although a standard by Dr. Kekunnaya and colleagues exists, it hasn't been universally adopted. After consulting with four doctors at our institute, we decided to implement the methodology proposed in Dr. Kekunnaya's paper.
                        </div>
                        <a href="https://hyderabadeyeresear-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/prashanthr_lvpei_net/EY01zuLgWw9Gk2MncIsi2MQBh-sL0-cA-JOeQGCfT2oowg?e=LYBbgU" class="paper" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" src="./images/Projects/eye-fi/kekunaya_paper.png" alt="a screenshot of a research paper" class="research-paper"></a>
                        <div>Once we fixed on the algorithm to use to determine the degree of DRS, we spent time brainstorming about various methods to get measurements</div>
                        <div>Each of us were experimenting on various approaches. We tried following approaches</div>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span><strong>Deep Learning-Based Point Detection</strong>:</span> Utilize a deep learning approach to identify key facial points (such as the top and bottom of the eyelid, center of the pupil, etc.). These coordinates can then be used to calculate the necessary distances.</li>
                            <li><span><strong>Computer Vision Approach</strong>:</span> Implement a method that involves converting the image to grayscale and employing Harr-Cascade classifiers and blob detection techniques to locate the iris. Subsequent adjustments to the program would enable distance measurements.</li>
                            <li><span><strong>Exploring Pre-Existing Models</strong>:</span> Conduct a thorough search for existing models that may be adapted or integrated into our solution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div>We quickly ruled out the deep learning solution due to a lack of sufficient data and resources necessary for training an effective model. Our initial attempts with a computer vision-based approach yielded moderate success. However, this method had to be ultimately set aside as the accuracy of the results was significantly impacted by variables such as lighting conditions and the positioning of the subject in the image. A pivotal moment came when we engaged in a discussion with a senior Microsoft engineer present at the venue, who introduced us to the Microsoft Azure Face API.</div>
                        <div>The Microsoft Azure Face API demonstrated remarkable proficiency in detecting major landmarks on various face images. Through extensive experimentation with a diverse array of images, we achieved a notably high success rate, underscoring the robustness and reliability of the API.</div>
                        <div class="research-grouping">

                        </div>
                        <div>An advantageous aspect of our approach was leveraging Kekunnaya's algorithm, which primarily relies on calculating ratios. This meant that calibration issues, often a concern in such applications, did not affect our results, significantly enhancing the reliability of our method.</div>
                        <div>Our mentor highlighted a critical concern: ensuring data security against potential breaches. This is especially paramount given that the iris constitutes a biometric signature, and the leakage of such sensitive images could lead to significant ramifications. To address this issue, we opted to integrate the Zeiss Visuhealth API, renowned for its secure and accurate transmission of ocular images over the Internet, facilitating communication between doctors and patients. Consequently, our final architecture incorporated this API as a key component to ensure enhanced data security.</div>

                            TJ Distributors, co-founded by <strong>Mr. Joseph Mathew</strong> and <strong>Mr. Tenson M Jacob</strong>, 
                            marks a new chapter in the realm of distribution, specifically in the steel and aluminum utensils sector. 
                            This venture, rooted in a rich heritage, commenced as a bold step by these two industry veterans. Both founders, 
                            previously key figures at Anna Aluminium Company—a titan in aluminum utensil manufacturing—decided to embark 
                            on their entrepreneurial journey after dedicating three decades to their former employer.

                            The company originated in Ernakulam, Kerala, with a modest customer base of just 10 businesses. Remarkably, 
                            over the past two years, TJ Distributors has witnessed a meteoric rise, now proudly catering to over 500 small 
                            businesses across the region. This growth trajectory not only reflects the founders' deep industry knowledge but 
                            also their unwavering commitment to quality and service.

                            of India. This wide assortment underlines the company's dedication to offering variety and quality to its clientele. 
                            As the son of Mr. Joseph Mathew, I have had the unique opportunity to witness and be a part of this entrepreneurial 
                            success story, observing firsthand the resilience and strategic acumen that have been the cornerstone of TJ Distributors' 
                            impressive expansion.

                            <li>Next, a chinwag with the big guns – do they have a style or color preference? Maybe a secret love for neon green?</li>
                            <li>Then, it's market study time – what's going to make our target audience's heads turn?</li>

                        <!-- <ul>
                            <li>The founders are fans of the 'keep-it-simple' club. They want a logo that’s like a perfect espresso – small, but packs a punch.</li>
                            <li>Adding the name, founding year, or a tagline to the logo? They left that ball in my court.</li>
                            <li>A rainbow of colors? Nope, they prefer to keep the color palette more minimalist than a zen garden.</li>

                            <p>Mr. Joseph and Mr. Tenson recently tasked me with creating a website to facilitate interactions with sellers in the northern part of India, primarily to overcome language barriers and introduce their company. Given the challenging timeline, I had only three days to deliver a solution, and this is the result. At present, I've halted further updates on this site due to other commitments and a lack of necessity at this point. However, I plan to return and overhaul the site as the business grows and, of course, if they are willing to compensate me for my services.</p>

                            This project holds a special place in my journey as it represents many of my 'firsts.' It was my initial foray into branding, encompassing my very first logo design, and my debut in using Illustrator. Additionally, it was the first time I designed and developed a website from the ground up, among other milestones. While the outcomes may not be groundbreaking, the confidence I gained from this experience is immeasurable. I've dedicated a unique section in my portfolio to this project as a reminder of its significant role in encouraging me to venture beyond my comfort zone. I extend heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Joseph Mathew (my father) and Mr. Tenson for providing me with this opportunity. Although I recognize that financial constraints played a part in my selection, their trust in my abilities to deliver was invaluable.

                        <p>
                            My tenure at <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> was not just about contributing to advanced technology; it also offered me invaluable opportunities for learning and growth in <em>networking</em> and <em>software engineering</em>. A key focus for me has always been enhancing <strong>user experience</strong>. In every project I undertake, I strive to integrate this principle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working at Cisco instilled in me the significance of adopting <strong>first-principles thinking</strong>, combined with a <em>user-centric approach</em>. This philosophy steers away from settling for merely the best available solution, and instead, aims for the optimal solution. I believe this mindset is particularly vital in <strong>healthcare technology design</strong>, where we need solutions that address the root of problems, not just superficial fixes.

                        <div>
                            <p>My fascination with Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in my sophomore year, a time when AI was just starting to gain widespread attention. My curiosity about this emerging field was piqued, leading me to explore what AI really entailed.</p>

                            <p>I am deeply grateful to <strong>Mr. Vignesh Kothappalli</strong>, my basketball teammate and one of the pioneers of <strong>IITG.ai</strong> – a community of AI enthusiasts at IIT Guwahati. Through IITG.ai and <strong>Prof. Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera</strong>, I took my first steps in Machine Learning.</p>
                            
                            <p>At IIT Hyderabad, under the mentorship of <strong>Prof. Sumohana Channappayya</strong>, I dived into Generative Models. This experience rapidly advanced my understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). During my internship, I engaged in several projects utilizing GANs, culminating in a victory at the <strong>Engineering the Eye Hackathon</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>Post-internship, I continued participating in various projects with the IITG.ai community and embarked on personal projects. My journey led me to an internship at <strong>Samsung Research Institute Noida</strong>, in the multimedia department of the smartphone division. Here, my team and I developed a facial attribute editing app using STGAN – a groundbreaking technology at the time. The project's success earned us recognition as one of the best projects and a coveted <strong>pre-Placement Offer</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>Further expanding my skillset, I delved into computer vision and the mathematical modeling of AI models. <strong>Prof. M K Bhuyan's</strong> classes immensely helped me grasp the intricacies of computer vision. Additionally, <strong>Prof. Tony Jacob's course</strong> on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning and <strong>Prof. Hanumant Singh Shekhawat's course</strong> on Applied Mathematics profoundly expanded my understanding of AI and ML, offering deep insights into their mathematical foundations.</p>

                        <div>
                            For our Electrical Engineering coursework, we undertook a digital design lab project. At that time, Akash was focused on software programming, Gaurav on hardware design, and I was immersed in AI and ML. Gaurav's idea seemed like a perfect opportunity, and we couldn't pass it up. We were fortunate to have Prof. Shaik Rafi Ahmed, a renowned figure in our department, as our mentor. His guidance was crucial for our success. Developing the algorithms took us about two months, followed by another month for procuring materials. Assembling everything on a breadboard was a meticulous task; the slightest disturbance could disrupt our work. Despite these challenges, we completed the project on time and achieved outstanding results.

                            <!-- <h3>Problem #1: Extended Turnaround Time in Wedding Photography</h3>
                            <p>In recent times, wedding photography has witnessed a significant improvement in both the skill level of photographers and the quality of their equipment. However, there's been a notable decline in one crucial aspect: the turnaround time for delivering finished photos. This issue became personal for me during a series of weddings at the end of 2021, where I observed that the quickest delivery time among my circle was an astonishing nine months. Initially, I attributed this delay to potential laziness in photographers or editors. However, discussions with friends from various parts of India revealed a widespread occurrence of this problem. This led me to investigate the underlying causes of these extended delays.</p> -->

                            <h3>The Challenge of Photo Sharing</h3>
                            <p>As an enthusiastic photographer at events, I constantly find myself capturing joyful moments. A recurring challenge arises post-event: the barrage of requests for photo sharing. The already slow return of professional photos exacerbates this issue. When asked about this, I learned that people wanted the photos/videos as soon as possible to post on their social media platforms. "Why they need to post it there as soon as possible, I have no idea." Filtering out photos of people from my gallery and sending them to each individual was a very tedious manual task until Google Photos made it somewhat easier. But still, it's a hassle to share the album etc. to everyone.</p>

                            <h3>Identifying a Technological Solution</h3>
                            <p>Reflecting on this problem, it's apparent that there is an opportunity for a technological solution that addresses the cumbersome process of personal photo sharing. This solution could streamline and expedite the entire process, benefiting photographers, event participants, and eager social media users alike.</p>

                                <p>In the initial phase of the research, I conducted phone and in-person interviews with a diverse group of participants. This included nine wedding photographers, each affiliated with a different studio, along with five newly-married couples, and eight family members from these couples. This approach was designed to ensure representation across all relevant categories. From the discussions about their problems, three distinct user personas were identified, as follows.</p>

                                <li>Through this project, I extensively honed my skills in utilizing Figma plugins and FigJam, exploring their full potential.</li>
                                <li>The project turned into an insightful journey with each user interview unveiling new challenges. A standout revelation was the photographers' struggle with extended turnaround times, often dealing with over 400,000 photos for a single wedding. The daunting task of selecting and editing the best shots highlighted a significant opportunity for my app. By integrating computer vision algorithms, the app could automate the removal of duplicates and poor-quality images, and even recommend the best shots to photographers. This underscored the importance of active listening and asking open-ended questions to uncover deeper insights.</li>

                                <li>Dr. Treesa Syril and I conducted interviews with 12 doctors and approximately 50 patients to gain insights into the challenges faced within the healthcare system.</li>

                                <li>We uncovered several significant issues from both the doctors' and patients' perspectives.</li>
                                <li>Key challenges identified include inadequate physical infrastructure, limited manpower, poor patient awareness, and notably, a lack of technology adoption.</li>
                                <li>Our recommendation is the implementation of user-friendly technological solutions to enhance interactions between patients and doctors within the system.</li>
                                <li>Currently, there is a stark absence of digital, user-friendly data collection methods. Given the rise of AI, developing a solution for this gap is imperative.</li>

                        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                        <div class="content">
                            <p>Many of my schoolmates from <strong>Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Malampuzha, Palakkad</strong>, became doctors, transforming our small gatherings into discussions about the challenges in the healthcare industry. These included frustrations with their work and the educational system, topics I initially paid little attention to. However, my perspective shifted dramatically when my aunt, the family's mainstay after the loss of my grandparents, was diagnosed with <strong>stage 4 triple-negative breast cancer</strong>. This news was devastating, shattering our family's happiness overnight. Based on what I had learned from conversations with my doctor friends, I braced for a grim outcome.</p>

                            <p>Her treatment began with a mastectomy and radiotherapy, and for a while, it seemed she was improving. Then, unexpectedly, everything deteriorated. A PET scan revealed further growth; the cancer had returned. Dissatisfied with her current treatment, we transferred her to <strong>Amrita Hospital, Ernakulam</strong>, under the care of <strong>Dr. Wesley M Jose</strong>. It was then we discovered a critical oversight in her initial post-surgical imaging, where some cancerous growth had been missed.</p>

                            <p>This revelation left me furious and deeply concerned about flaws in our healthcare system. Determined to address these issues, I sought the expertise of <strong>Dr. Treesa Syril from Madurai Medical College</strong>. Dr. Treesa, with her extensive experience as a medical student, UG resident, and practicing doctor, joined me in a thorough investigation. Our goal was to document the system's challenges and explore potential solutions.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #1</h2>
                            <h1>“It is so crowded and we have to wait a long time to see our doctor”</h1>
                            <p>Every participant <strong>expressed concern</strong> over the same issue. As these are <em>government-run hospitals</em> without corporate involvement or digital integration, there's no system for booking appointments or managing crowds. The <strong>inadequate waiting space</strong> complicates matters for patients, making waiting uncomfortable. The situation is further aggravated by the challenging weather conditions. This issue is particularly distressing for patients from lower socio-economic backgrounds who rely on daily earnings; <em>every minute spent waiting at the hospital impacts their income</em>. In our survey with patients, the <strong>average waiting time was found to be 52 minutes</strong>. Furthermore, with only <strong>9.1 doctors per 10,000 people</strong>, the capacity to meet patient demand is severely constrained.</p>
                            <p>Most of the individuals we interviewed were <strong>daily wage workers</strong> accessing the healthcare system, who cannot afford to spend excessive time in hospitals as <em>it directly affects their wages</em>. From the hospital's standpoint, <strong>addressing these problems is a significant challenge</strong>. Improving patient management would necessitate hiring more staff and expanding waiting areas, which is not expected to happen soon. A potential improvement could be the <strong>digitization of appointment systems</strong> and assigning specific time slots to patients. However, this solution faces obstacles due to the overwhelming patient load and the <em>insufficient number of doctors and staff</em>. Despite these challenges, <strong>we believe that incorporating more technological solutions could lead to significant improvements</strong>.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #2</h2>
                            <h1>“It is so confusing where to go and which doctor to consult”</h1>
                            <p><strong>Many patients voiced confusion</strong> regarding navigation within hospital premises. This is exacerbated by the hospitals' typically <em>complex, maze-like layouts</em>, with interconnected hallways and multiple floors, making it difficult to find specific departments or doctors. A survey by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality revealed that <strong>nearly one-third of first-time visitors</strong> to large hospital complexes struggle to locate their destinations, highlighting a widespread issue.</p>
                            <p>Lack of clear and effective signage contributes significantly to this confusion. In many cases, signage is either non-existent or poorly placed, failing to adequately guide patients and visitors, especially in emergencies. <strong>Illiterate patients find it particularly challenging</strong> to read name boards, and being unfamiliar with medical terms related to diseases and tests, they also face difficulties in asking for directions. Language and accessibility barriers further complicate navigation for patients with diverse backgrounds and specific accessibility needs.</p>
                            <p>To improve navigation, experts recommend <strong>clear signage</strong> with legible fonts and universally understood symbols, <em>architectural cues</em> like distinct visual landmarks, and a <strong>user-centered design approach</strong>. Incorporating technology, such as mobile apps with indoor maps and real-time directions, QR codes, and augmented reality, can further enhance the patient experience. Additionally, the establishment of a <strong>general helpdesk</strong> for inquiries, a feature commonly found in private hospitals but lacking in government-run facilities, could significantly streamline the process and reduce patient anxiety. These measures not only reduce patient anxiety but also improve operational efficiency by minimizing the need for staff to constantly provide directions.</p>

                            <h1>“Private hospitals are very costly and the diagnostic tests are unaffordable”</h1>
                            <p>The high costs in <strong>private hospitals</strong> in India can largely be attributed to their nature as profit-driven entities. Since private hospitals are owned by private entities, their primary objective is to make a profit, which often results in higher treatment and service costs compared to public hospitals. This situation highlights the <strong>urgent need for improvements in the public healthcare system</strong>.</p>
                        
                            <p>There is a common perception that private hospitals generally offer <strong>better facilities</strong>, and this is often the case. However, <strong>people from poor socio-economic backgrounds</strong> find it very hard to access these facilities due to the cost. For major treatments, unless the patient is doing well financially or has insurance, it becomes nearly impossible to afford treatment. This is particularly troubling considering that only <strong>4% of patients</strong> we interviewed had some form of health insurance, underscoring the accessibility barrier posed by high costs.</p>
                        
                            <p>It's crucial to recognize that some of <strong>India's best doctors work within the public healthcare system</strong>. This represents an opportunity to leverage the expertise available in public hospitals to enhance the overall quality of healthcare in the country.</p>
                        
                            <p>Improving public healthcare facilities could offer a more <strong>affordable and accessible alternative</strong> to private hospitals, especially for those who cannot afford the high costs of private healthcare. The expertise of top doctors in the public sector, combined with improved infrastructure and resources, could significantly enhance the public healthcare services' effectiveness and appeal.</p>
                        
                            <p>Efforts to strengthen the public healthcare system should focus on addressing issues such as <strong>staff shortages, outdated equipment, and long waiting times</strong>. Additionally, <strong>increasing transparency in healthcare costs</strong> and ensuring fair pricing practices are essential steps towards making healthcare more accessible and affordable for all.</p>

                            <h1>“We do not get most of the medicines that doctor prescribes to us”</h1>
                            <p>This issue <em>wasn't a major concern</em> for the patients we interviewed, despite widespread media coverage about doctors prescribing hard-to-get medicines. Most of the medicines prescribed were <strong>generic and readily available</strong> in hospitals. However, discussions with the pharmacy assistant at Govt Medical College Ernakulam indicated occasional shortages due to factors like <em>short shelf life</em> or specific <strong>storage conditions</strong>, such as the need for refrigeration, which can be costly.</p>
                            <p>An effective strategy could involve <strong>stocking medicines targeting prevalent diseases</strong> in specific regions. The challenge, however, lies in the lack of data collection, making it difficult to implement this approach. Additionally, broader factors like <em>transportation, costs, and health literacy</em> significantly impact patients' ability to access prescribed medicines.</p>

                            <h1>“No discharge summary or treatment data for future reference”</h1>
                            <p>The issue of <strong>inadequate discharge summaries and treatment data</strong> in the Indian public healthcare system is compounded by current systemic limitations. Most data is not systematically collected or stored, and in critical cases, discharge summaries are often <em>handwritten by junior doctors</em>, potentially leading to the omission of important details.</p>
                        
                            <p>Integrating this with findings from a study conducted in Himachal Pradesh and Kerala, it becomes evident that the lack of structured and comprehensive discharge information can <strong>severely impact patient care</strong>. This is particularly risky in scenarios where patients return for the same or a different disease, and doctors have no previous context to rely upon. Patients, especially those not medically trained, might unintentionally omit crucial details, potentially endangering their lives.</p>
                        
                            <p>The study found that <em>poor discharge communication</em> is associated with negative health outcomes, including increased mortality and worsening of chronic conditions. Less than a quarter of patients received lifestyle advice, and only 31% of discharge notes contained all necessary details for continuity of care. Such deficiencies highlight the urgent need for improvements in discharge communication practices.</p>
                        
                            <p>The need for <strong>digitization in the Indian healthcare system</strong> is paramount in addressing these issues. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) and the introduction of the <strong>Unified Health ID</strong> are significant steps towards this goal. The ABDM aims to create a digital health ecosystem that supports the online availability of health data, which, if implemented effectively, could revolutionize the continuity of care. The Unified Health ID allows for the integration of medical records across platforms and institutions, ensuring that a patient's health history is accessible whenever and wherever needed, thus greatly enhancing the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery.</p>
                        
                            <p>Implementing electronic health records (EHRs) under the framework of ABDM can provide several benefits:</p>
                        
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Accurate and Comprehensive Data Collection</strong>: EHRs facilitate the systematic recording of patient data, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care.</li>
                                <li><strong>Continuity of Care</strong>: Digital records enable healthcare providers to access a patient's history, ensuring informed decision-making for ongoing and future treatments.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reduced Risk of Errors</strong>: Digitization minimizes human errors associated with handwritten notes and improves the overall quality of discharge summaries.</li>
                                <li><strong>Enhanced Patient Safety</strong>: Accurate and accessible patient data lead to better treatment outcomes and patient safety.</li>
                                <li><strong>Efficient Healthcare Delivery</strong>: EHRs streamline various processes, making healthcare delivery more efficient and reducing the burden on healthcare professionals.</li>
                            </ul>
                        
                            <p>To effectively address these issues, a concerted effort is required to upgrade the existing healthcare infrastructure, invest in digital technologies, and train healthcare professionals in using these systems. This shift towards digital health records, combined with the ABDM's initiatives like the Unified Health ID, and improved communication and documentation practices, is crucial for enhancing patient care and safety in the Indian public healthcare system.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #7</h2>
                            <h1>“Doctors are sometimes insensitive to our concerns. We are just another medical case. There is no concept of individual care”</h1>
                            <p>The concern about doctors sometimes being insensitive to patient needs, treating them as just another medical case, and not providing individualized care, is a significant issue in the healthcare system in India. A poignant anecdote from Dr. Vipin of the Government Medical College Alappuzha illustrates this challenge. He describes a day when he encountered three deaths due to a road accident during his tenure as a house surgeon, which had desensitized him to such gory scenes. Later that day, when treating a patient with a severely injured leg, Dr. Vipin's routine approach provoked the patient's bystander, who accused him of insensitivity. This incident highlights the <strong>difficult balance</strong> that doctors must maintain between professional detachment and emotional response.</p>
                        
                            <p>In medical colleges, where the primary focus is often on learning and handling cases, <strong>personal relationships with patients</strong> can sometimes take a back seat. However, there is a need for a <strong>middle ground approach</strong>. Training for doctors that emphasizes <strong>empathy and emotional intelligence</strong> is crucial in improving the doctor-patient relationship. Such training can help medical professionals understand and manage their emotions while maintaining the necessary detachment. With only <strong>9.1 doctors per 10,000 people</strong>, the overload on doctors can lead to physical or mental exhaustion, sometimes causing them to lose their patience or appear insensitive.</p>
                        
                            <p>Furthermore, protocols like <strong>SPIKES</strong>, designed to guide healthcare professionals in delivering difficult news to patients, are often only taught theoretically, with no practical training provided. There is a significant need for <em>occasional practical training</em> on being compassionate, empathetic, and maintaining effective communication with patients. Simultaneously, <strong>patient education</strong> about the challenges doctors face is important. An understanding of the mental and emotional toll on doctors, especially in high-stress environments, can lead to better appreciation and cooperation from patients. By incorporating training in empathy for doctors, practical application of communication protocols like SPIKES, and educating patients on the realities of medical practice, the healthcare system can foster more <strong>compassionate and effective healthcare</strong>.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #8</h2>
                            <h1>“We have no idea who is treating us”</h1>
                            <p>The concern that patients often do not know who is treating them in hospitals highlights a larger issue in <strong>healthcare communication</strong> and <em>patient care management</em>. This problem is particularly pronounced in busy hospital environments where patients may interact with a variety of healthcare professionals, each with their own distinct roles and responsibilities. This multiplicity of caregivers can make patients feel lost in the system, undermining their sense of individualized care.</p>
                        
                            <p><strong>Effective communication</strong> is crucial in mitigating this issue. Healthcare professionals require comprehensive training in communication skills, focusing on clear, empathetic interactions with patients. This training should underline the importance of healthcare providers introducing themselves and explaining their role in the patient's care, fostering trust and ensuring that patients are better informed about their treatment journey. Additionally, the implementation of <strong>digital displays or some form of display</strong> in hospitals could significantly improve patient experience by providing real-time information about the availability of doctors and their timings. Many patients have expressed frustration over traveling long distances to the hospital, only to find out that the doctor they wanted to see was not available. An <em>online facility</em> for checking doctor availability and scheduling appointments would be an ideal solution, although its feasibility needs careful consideration.</p>
                        
                            <p>Furthermore, the organization of care in hospitals, which often involves managing multiple patients simultaneously, can lead to brief and impersonal interactions. To counter this, healthcare systems need to explore ways to optimize patient-to-doctor ratios and workflows, enabling more <em>personalized care</em> without compromising the quality of medical treatment.</p>
                        
                            <p><em>Patient education</em> about the hospital care process is also essential. Informing patients about the typical structure of hospital teams and the roles of various healthcare professionals can set more realistic expectations and reduce feelings of anonymity and confusion.</p>
                        
                            <p>Improvements in the <strong>doctor-patient relationship</strong> and communication within healthcare settings are imperative for addressing the concerns of patients feeling disconnected from their caregivers. While systemic changes in healthcare delivery and staffing may be necessary to fully resolve these issues, individual healthcare providers can make significant contributions by prioritizing and improving communication with their patients.</p>

                            <h1>“It is dirty and unhygienic here”</h1>
                            <p>Hygiene challenges in public hospitals are a matter of significant concern, arising from a variety of systemic factors. A fundamental issue is the <strong>shortage of maintenance staff</strong>, which severely impacts the ability to maintain cleanliness. This is often exacerbated by <strong>overcrowding</strong>, as a high volume of patients and visitors overburden hospital facilities, leading to rapid deterioration in hygiene standards. A lack of public awareness and adherence to proper hygiene practices further aggravates the situation.</p>

                            <p>Another critical issue is the <strong>inadequacy of waste management systems</strong>. Many hospitals face challenges with efficient waste disposal and treatment, partly due to infrastructural constraints that impede effective waste management. This problem is particularly acute in common areas and wards, in contrast to the higher levels of cleanliness maintained in more critical areas like operation theatres and laboratories.</p>

                            <p>Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach. This includes <strong>upgrading waste disposal technologies</strong>, providing extensive training for staff in hygiene and sanitation practices, and implementing <strong>stringent cleanliness protocols</strong>. The selection and use of cleaning and disinfecting products are also key, requiring a balance between effectiveness, safety, and environmental impact.</p>

                            <p>The <strong>training and empowerment of environmental hygiene personnel</strong> are essential. Their role is critical, and improving their training, certification, and clarity of responsibilities can significantly enhance cleaning standards. Effective coordination among staff and clear task allocation are vital for maintaining high hygiene standards.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, <strong>community engagement and education on hygiene practices</strong> are crucial for cultivating a culture of cleanliness and responsibility. Supporting Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) programs and establishing international partnerships for WASH assessments in healthcare facilities can lead to substantial improvements in public hospital hygiene standards.</p>

                            <h1>“Hospital beds are not available at all. Sometimes we are asked to sleep on the floor, which feels very unhygienic”</h1>
                            <p>The acute shortage of hospital beds in India is a critical issue, significantly impacting patient care and safety. The scarcity is so severe that patients are sometimes compelled to sleep on the floor, raising serious concerns about hygiene and the risk of infection. This problem is a stark indicator of the broader challenges facing the country's healthcare infrastructure.</p>
                        
                            <p>One of the root causes of this dire situation is the inadequate healthcare spending by the government. Currently, India allocates only <strong>2.1% of its GDP to healthcare</strong>, positioning it at <em>178th globally</em> in terms of healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP. This level of investment is <strong>abysmal</strong> and insufficient to meet the vast needs of its population, leading to overstretched facilities and a critical shortage of essential resources like hospital beds.</p>
                        
                            <p>Statistically, India has only <strong>8.5 hospital beds per 10,000 people</strong>, a figure that falls significantly short of the global average and is insufficient for a country with such a vast population. This shortage is not merely a matter of numbers; it reflects a systemic issue that affects the quality of patient care, leading to compromised treatment outcomes and patient dissatisfaction.</p>
                        
                            <p>To address these challenges, there is an urgent need for increased healthcare expenditure to improve the infrastructure of hospitals. Investing in healthcare is not just about increasing the number of beds; it involves enhancing the overall quality of healthcare facilities, ensuring the availability of medical supplies, improving sanitation, and expanding the healthcare workforce. Such comprehensive improvements are essential for creating a more resilient and patient-centric healthcare system that can adequately meet the needs of India's population.</p>

                            <p>Healthcare workers in India, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, have faced severe <strong>overwork and underpayment</strong>. Contractual employment with limited rights, including <em>lack of proper salaries and leave</em>, has become the norm in many healthcare institutions. This 'use and throw' policy disregards the need for permanent appointments despite the evident human resource shortage in hospitals.</p>
                        
                            <p>The disregard for <strong>shift timings</strong> exacerbates the issue, with doctors often forced to stay back longer than their scheduled hours due to patient overflow. This additional time is <em>not compensated</em> in any form, further contributing to the sense of being undervalued. In our interviews, <strong>100% of doctors</strong> expressed that they are <em>overworked and underpaid</em>, highlighting the systemic neglect of healthcare professionals' rights and well-being.</p>
                        
                            <p>The <strong>psychological toll</strong> on these professionals is alarming.

                            <p>The tragic murder of Dr. Vandana Das in Kottarakkara, Kerala, on 10 May 2023, serves as a harrowing reminder of the dangers faced by healthcare workers. Dr. Das was fatally stabbed while on duty at Kottarakkara Taluk Hospital by an individual suffering from withdrawal paranoia, brought in by the police. This devastating incident has sparked widespread outrage among healthcare professionals in Kerala, leading to demands for stringent legal action to protect healthcare workers from violence.</p>
                        
                            <p>In response to these challenges, there is a growing consensus on the need to <strong>increase security in hospital premises</strong>, including a more substantial police presence, enhanced surveillance systems, and other safety measures to protect healthcare workers. Although India recognized violence against healthcare service personnel as a cognizable and non-bailable offense in April 2020, the need for <strong>more robust legislation and implementation</strong> to safeguard healthcare professionals effectively remains critical.</p>
                        
                            <p>The solution to this problem requires a <strong>comprehensive approach</strong>, including <em>improving the healthcare system's responsiveness, enhancing communication skills among medical professionals, and aligning medical treatment with the dignity and expectations of patients</em>. It is crucial to create an environment where healthcare providers can perform their duties without fear of violence, ensuring the well-being and safety of both patients and medical staff.</p>

                            <h2>Problem #3</h2>
                            <h1>“Patients never come for follow-up visits”</h1>
                            <p>Our survey, supported by insights from Dr. Sneha of Pariyaram Medical College, underscores a critical challenge in Indian healthcare: the reluctance of most patients to return for follow-up visits. Factors such as the average waiting time of 52 minutes and the long distances traveled, with some patients coming from as far as 108km, significantly deter follow-up visits. The majority of these patients, hailing from impoverished socio-economic backgrounds, are adversely impacted by every minute spent away from work, making follow-up visits a low priority.</p>
                        
                            <p>To mitigate this, <em>enhancing patient engagement</em> is crucial. Education on the importance of follow-up care is necessary, yet India's diverse cultural and linguistic landscape, coupled with uneven healthcare access and affordability issues, complicates engagement efforts. The <strong>financial and logistical barriers</strong> that patients face must be addressed to improve adherence to follow-up schedules.</p>
                        
                            <p>In response to these challenges, the Indian government has initiated several digital health programs aimed at enhancing patient follow-up and treatment adherence. The <strong>Ni-kshay app</strong>, designed for Tuberculosis patients, serves as a centralized platform for TB case management, enabling healthcare providers to track treatment adherence and patient progress. Similarly, initiatives like the <strong>Nikusht app for Leprosy patients</strong> aim to replicate this model for leprosy care, facilitating better monitoring and management of the disease. The <strong>99DOTS program</strong> is another innovative approach, which utilizes technology to ensure TB patients complete their treatment regimen. Patients receive their medication in blister packs with hidden phone numbers that are revealed only when the medication is dispensed. Patients are then required to call these numbers, providing a simple yet effective way to monitor adherence and support patients through their treatment journey.</p>
                        
                            <p>Despite the potential of these digital initiatives to transform patient care, their effectiveness is often hampered by implementation challenges, including infrastructure limitations and the need for greater awareness among both healthcare providers and patients. <em>Digital follow-up systems</em>, utilizing mobile technology for reminders, remote monitoring, and scheduling, offer a promising solution to maintain care continuity, particularly for chronic conditions. Enhancing local healthcare services and telemedicine options, alongside reducing direct costs, could significantly increase the rate of follow-up visits, ensuring improved health outcomes and more efficient disease management.</p>

                            <h1>“Sometimes patients go for alternative medicines or no treatment at all”</h1>
                            <p>Patients from poor economic backgrounds or with limited healthcare access often turn to alternative medicines or avoid treatment entirely. This trend is influenced by a combination of factors, including <strong>perceived benefits and safety</strong> of alternative treatments, <em>dissatisfaction with conventional medicine</em>, and <strong>economic considerations</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Cultural beliefs and societal norms also play a crucial role in these healthcare choices. In India, traditional medicine systems are often preferred due to their deep cultural roots. However, this can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, especially in severe cases, where patients turn to allopathic medicine only as a last resort. Consequently, healthcare providers face challenges in delivering effective care and are often unfairly blamed for poor outcomes.</p>

                            <p>Addressing this issue requires increasing <em>awareness and education</em> about the importance of timely and appropriate medical care. Additionally, improving access to affordable healthcare and integrating traditional and modern medicine practices could help bridge the gap and ensure better health outcomes for all patients.</p>

                            <p>With the advent of the internet, patients increasingly turn to online resources for self-diagnosing health issues before visiting a doctor. This trend of <strong>self-diagnosis</strong> can significantly influence the medical decision-making process, as patients often arrive with preconceived notions about their condition.</p>

                            <p>Such self-researched diagnoses can induce <em>diagnostic biases</em> in healthcare professionals, especially when under pressure or fatigue. This can lead to a tunnel vision effect, where doctors might focus more on the conditions suggested by the patient rather than conducting a comprehensive evaluation.</p>

                            <p>It's crucial to <strong>educate both patients and doctors</strong> about the biases that self-diagnosis can cause. Patients should be made aware of the limitations and potential inaccuracies of online medical information. At the same time, healthcare professionals should be trained to navigate these biases effectively, ensuring that patient inputs do not unduly sway the diagnostic process. <em>Open communication</em> and guiding patients towards reliable health resources are key to aligning patient expectations with medical realities, thus enhancing the effectiveness of healthcare delivery.</p>

                            <p><strong>Junior doctors are treated like absolute slaves here.</strong> Apart from the exhaustive medical responsibilities, some doctors have reported being assigned menial tasks such as <em>grocery shopping for seniors</em>. This practice not only detracts from their medical training but also indicates a worrying aspect of the professional culture in certain healthcare settings. People are absolutely exhausted all the time, and the risk of making mistakes due to physical exhaustion is alarmingly high. When these issues are raised with senior doctors, the response often reflects an outdated mindset: they endured it, so why can't the juniors?</p>
                            <p>Recent studies have highlighted the severe psychological impact of such environments on medical professionals. Shockingly, <strong>30% of doctors and medical students</strong> report experiencing depression, while <strong>80%</strong> express fear of potential burnout. Alarmingly, <strong>18% have had suicidal thoughts</strong>, underlining the urgent need for systemic change in the medical training and workplace culture.</p>
                            <p>The <em>Indian Medical Association Junior Doctors Network (IMA JDN)</em> is aware of these broader challenges, including workplace bullying, long hours, and exploitation.

                            <h1>“Under constant dilemma: Cost vs proper treatment and diagnostic tests”</h1>
                            <p>In the Indian public healthcare system, doctors often face a challenging dilemma: balancing the <em>cost of treatment</em> with the <em>need for proper diagnostic tests and medications</em>. This situation is further complicated by public skepticism towards healthcare professionals, fueled by isolated incidents and mass media portrayal. Patients commonly perceive that <strong>more medicines or additional diagnostic tests indicate either a lack of competence or an unethical motive</strong> on the doctor's part. This misconception has serious ramifications for healthcare delivery.</p>

                            <p>Younger doctors, in particular, find themselves pressured to rely on clinical judgment rather than comprehensive diagnostic evidence, fearing negative public perception and its impact on their professional reputation. This hesitancy to prescribe additional tests can <strong>compromise patient care</strong>.</p>

                            <p>Contrastingly, more experienced doctors, who began their careers when healthcare options were limited, didn't face such skepticism. They had the liberty to suggest additional tests and medicines without facing public distrust. Over time, these doctors have developed the ability to diagnose and treat with less reliance on numerous tests or medications.</p>

                            <p>However, recent developments in the Indian medical landscape have added new layers to this challenge. The <strong>National Medical Commission's directive</strong> mandating doctors to prescribe generic medicines has sparked considerable debate. While generic drugs offer a cost-effective alternative to branded medicines, there are concerns about their efficacy, quality, and the lack of standardized testing. This directive has been met with opposition from medical associations, citing its potential impact on patient care and doctors' autonomy.</p>

                            <p>Moreover, studies reveal that <em>doctors' negative perceptions of generic medicines</em> have been a significant barrier to their acceptance. Over 50% of pharmaceutical formulations in India are fixed dose combinations (FDCs), many of which are considered therapeutically non-beneficial and unsafe. This situation underscores the need for <strong>improved regulatory oversight and quality assurance in pharmaceuticals</strong>.</p>

                            <p>To navigate these complexities, several strategies are essential:</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Patient Education</strong>: Educating patients about the importance of diagnostic tests and the role of generic medicines in effective treatment can help in alleviating misconceptions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Improved Communication</strong>: Building trust through open doctor-patient communication about treatment choices, including the use of generics, is vital.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regulatory Oversight and Quality Assurance</strong>: Ensuring the efficacy and safety of generic drugs through stringent regulatory mechanisms is crucial for maintaining trust in the healthcare system.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The Indian healthcare system is at a crossroads. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from healthcare professionals, regulatory bodies, and the public. By fostering an environment of trust, transparency, and quality assurance, we can ensure that decisions in healthcare are made in the best interest of patient care and public health.</p>

                                Moreover, the focus shouldn't just be on infrastructural changes. <em>Patient education and awareness</em> are pivotal in this transformation. An informed patient community can make more effective use of the healthcare system, easing some of the existing burdens. Continuous training and development for doctors are equally crucial, ensuring that they remain at the forefront of medical advancements and patient care practices.

                            <p>
                                Additionally, establishing a robust and accessible complaint portal could significantly improve accountability and responsiveness in the healthcare system. This would not only empower patients but also provide valuable feedback for continual improvement.

                            <p>
                                In conclusion, while the challenges are daunting, the path to a more efficient, accessible, and patient-friendly public healthcare system in India is clear. It requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, leveraging technology, education, and policy reform, to bring about a profound and lasting change in the healthcare landscape.

                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;<span class="first-letter">I</span> was a great student throughout my school days, earning a GPA of 10.0 in class X and securing 94.6% in class XII. The next step seemed obvious: either Engineering or Medicine. However, since I developed a strong aversion to biology at that time (ironically, all the books I read now are directly or indirectly related to the field of medicine), I decided to pursue a career in Engineering. Opting for one of the best colleges in India for this path, I set my sights on IIT and prepared for the formidable IIT-JEE exam, considered the toughest in Asia. So far, so good. Now what? The best coaching center in Kerala (my home state in India) was Brilliant Coaching Centre, situated in the beautiful town of Pala. The efforts it took for my family and me to secure admission there warrant another article in itself.
                            </p>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Classes began, and everything was going well — in fact, it was going great. I felt like a hungry child during a famine, eagerly waiting for the morsels of wisdom being dispensed by these professors. I was confident, envisioning myself on the front pages of the next year's newspaper as the top-ranked student. This optimism continued until the very first exam.
                            </p>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I distinctly remember feeling fairly confident even after the exam. I mean, I could have performed better, but it certainly wasn't my worst effort. However, the glass castle I had built in just a week came crashing down when the results were declared that very evening. I was ranked 384 out of 391 people. WTF!!
                            </p>
                            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This revelation devastated me. For the next two weeks or so, I couldn't focus on my studies at all, constantly haunted by thoughts of the money my parents had invested in me by enrolling in this coaching center. And my ranks reflected the lackluster effort.
                            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Then one day, I got ready early, had breakfast at the hostel canteen, and found myself wondering what I was doing there. I pondered that everyone around me was essentially doing the same thing — attending classes, listening to lectures, taking notes, studying until late, and then sleeping. Most people even referred to the same books. My thought was, if everyone is doing the same thing, how can someone be better than the other? The person sitting next to me is following the same routine. How can I surpass him? While I acknowledge that some people possess better grasping power or memory, the processes are generally the same. Given my inclination to plan and strategize throughout my life, I decided to do the same again.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;What could I do better?
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps I could work harder, but this seemed nearly impossible as the institution ensured that we didn't waste a second throughout the day. With only 24 hours available, there was simply no more time.
            
            The only option left was to optimize what I was currently doing.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In a moment of inspiration, a book crossed my mind — "You Can Win" by Shiv Kera. My father had gifted me this book. Honestly, I hadn't even opened it at the time of writing, but I vividly recall two sentences written on the cover: "Winners don't do different things. They do things differently."
            </p>
            <p><em>(Note: For organizing the passage, I am grouping the strategies into two categories — Exam Preparation Strategies and Exam Taking Strategies. This clear distinction was not present when I initially formulated these plans; I was simply exploring new ways to optimize. I am organizing it this way based on the feedback I received after the first draft. This will make it easier to review the issues I faced and the solutions I devised.)

            <h2>1. Exam preparation strategies</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>1.1 No motivation to study or losing motivation down the line</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I've had enough experiences with pep talks, motivation videos, etc. It worked maybe for 5 minutes but died down pretty quickly. I was always motivated to study in class and also in workouts for the sports I played throughout my school. After much introspection, I realized that it's the small victories in each domain that were pushing me. So I decided to track my rank in a notebook. The thought process was that if I can better my rank by at least 2-3 positions every exam, this might motivate me further.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h3>1.2 Can’t focus in class/feeling sleepy in class</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Another area I found myself struggling with is feeling sleepy in my class. But I already had a trick up my sleeve. I had noticed in my school days that I could stay awake and focus if I try to write notes beautifully. I tried to make my notes the best possible ones out there. I would try various color pens, underline, etc. People often made fun of me, but it worked wonders for me. If some topic is tough to understand, I would not even try to spend time understanding while the class is going on. I just blindly copied whatever is on the board or whatever the prof said to my notes. What I did is, later on the same day, when my mind is clearer, and when I am fresh, sit and read through my notes and try to understand concepts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1.3 Which book to refer?</h3> 
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I wavered between multiple books for the same topic, which was time-consuming. What I decided is to stick with one book for each subject. I called this the “master reference.” I refer to the notes I made in class and read the master reference at the same time each day after class. If some topic is not there in the master reference, or let's say I did not understand some topic from the master reference, only then I would venture out into other books. I remember at one point, I was spending a lot of time going book to book for some obscure topic. I immediately realized that I could just ask around other people. And this would save an immense amount of time.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I started leaving gaps in my class notes to be filled later. What I did after the classes is, I would refer to the master reference or, if needed, ask around and read from some other source about a topic and then if I find something useful, maybe an example which makes my concepts clearer, I would note it down in the gaps in my notes. If the thing that is to be added is too big or vast, I would simply mention the book and page number and edition there. My goal was to have a single point of reference towards the end.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>1.4 How to make proper use of the practice/model exams?</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I made a lot of mistakes during the exam. But I noticed that when the next exam came, I had no memory of any of the mistakes that I committed in the previous exam that happened just a week ago. The goal is to learn from the mistakes and move forward. But what if I don’t even remember the mistakes at all?
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;To tackle this, I decided to painstakingly record my mistakes. I knew this was a time-consuming ordeal, but I wanted to try something different, and it made sense theoretically. It was too hard in the beginning, but I forced myself to write it for 2-3 exams. After which this just became a habit.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;To make it more engaging, I started writing in Malayalam, my mother tongue, as well as started making it funny.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I can easily call this my “master stroke in exam preparation” looking back.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I could immediately see the results. I was slowly ascending in the rank ladder. I understood that my strategies are paying off. So I was constantly searching on what I could improve. This became an obsession actually. I would experiment in each and every exam with time management, bubbling strategy, etc. Till about February first week, I attended each and every exam a different way. I would immediately analyze the exam and whatever worked, I stuck on to it. And whatever did not work, I simply recorded it and moved on.

            <h2>2. Exam taking strategies</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>2.1 Zoning out during exam</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;I tend to zone out during the exam a lot. This was the hardest challenge for me. I can’t afford to do that in exams where time mattered a lot like KEAM, JEE MAIN, CUSAT, etc. Sometimes I would just keep on reading a question 5-10 times (not an exaggeration!) without actually understanding what it meant. I told this problem to a counselor arranged by the coaching center, and she gave a breathing technique. Where when I feel like I can’t focus, just keep the pen down, close the eyes and take 3 long deep breaths and then immediately look at the question. This time make up my mind that I have to understand each and every word. I honestly think that the final “making up my mind” did the trick, but I went along with all the steps. As I noticed that this was bringing down my stress also during the exam. There was one more trick which I have explained in the next point.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2.2 Time management</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;What worked for me in time management is always looking at the clock. Many of the seniors advised against this, as it will make us anxious. But I had a habit of zoning out during the exam. I would keep on reading the same question again and again, grasping nothing. I kept on experimenting and what I would do is allocate some time for each question at the beginning of the exam. If it was an exam with the same weightage for all the questions like KEAM, JEE MAIN, CUSAT, etc, I would simply divide the total time by the number of questions. I would keep on looking at the watch after every question to keep track of this time. This was slightly helpful to be on my toes and not zoning out.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>2.3 Bubbling strategy for answers</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Bubbling was not a big deal for JEE advanced. But I realized that it was a great deal for exams like KEAM, CUSAT, where speed is utmost important. All the professors told me to bubble the OMR sheet right away when I get an answer. But I figured that this was taking an extra 10 seconds off of my time. so I wanted to try something else. I kept on experimenting with various stuff. I concluded that I could save much time if I am answering 30 questions and marking them together in the OMR sheet. If I made any mistake, still the collateral damage was limited to 30 questions only rather than the entire exam.
            </p><br>
            <h3>2.4 Exam day routine</h3>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;One piece of advice I received from my seniors is to make the exam experience as normal as possible. On the exam day, it should feel like any other day. I noticed that in my previous attempt, everything went wrong that day. I had to wake up extremely early, which was unusual for me, had to bathe early in the morning, again unusual. Have breakfast early in the morning, even going to the toilet that early was weird to me. And during the exam, at one point, I wanted to go to the bathroom. So I remembered this and tried to align my daily routine to the exam day events as much as possible. I think this worked as I was actually very cool on the exam day. I did not feel any pressure at all and it felt like any other day.
            </p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;As you can see, I was becoming obsessive about this. Now when I look back, I realize that I was not really passionate about the exam. But I was actually obsessing over planning and strategizing stuff.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Ending Note</h2>
            
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;You see, I got kinda obsessed with all of this. Now that I think about it, I wasn't really crazy about the exam itself. Maybe I was just super into planning and figuring out strategies.
            
            Looking back at my JEE journey, it's pretty clear that success didn't come easy. I started off ranked 384 out of 391, but with some strategic moves, I ended up in 24th place. It wasn't just about acing exams; it was about being tough, adaptable, and smart in problem-solving.
            
            I made a major comeback in the JEE Advanced exam, going from not making the qualification mark in my first ever JEE mains attempt to snagging the 4407th All India Rank and landing a spot at IIT Guwahati.
            
            This whole ride wasn't just about hitting the books; it taught me to be resilient, flexible, and strategic in everything I do. Those lessons weren't confined to classrooms or exam halls; they spilled over into life's everyday challenges.
            
            While my tactics might not work for everyone, they highlight the importance of knowing yourself, staying strong, and tweaking your game plan when things get tough. As I wrap up this chapter, I'm taking those lessons with me, ready to tackle whatever comes my way with the same strategic mindset. The journey never really stops, and the quest for excellence keeps going.

            <p><b>Can't focus in class:</b> Combated sleepiness in class by making detailed, visually appealing notes.
            Reserved difficult topics for post-class study sessions when the mind was clearer.</p>
            
            <p><b>Master Reference Approach:</b> Selected one primary reference book per subject, reducing time wasted on multiple sources.
            Left gaps in class notes to be filled later, aiming for a single point of reference.</p>
            
            <p><b>Learning from Practice Exams:</b> Systematically recorded mistakes from each practice exam in Malayalam for engagement.
            Experimented with exam strategies and continually refined approaches based on results.</p>

            <p><b>Overcoming Zoning Out:</b> A breathing technique to refocus during exams, addressing the tendency to zone out.
            Emphasized the importance of making up the mind to understand each question.</p> 
            
            
            <p><b>Time Management:</b> Constantly monitored the clock to combat zoning out during exams. Allocated specific time for each question at the beginning of exams to manage time effectively.</p> 
            
            
            <p><b>Bubbling Strategy:</b> Experimented with bubbling strategies to save time, such as marking answers for 30 questions together.</p> 
            <p><b>Maintaining a Normal Exam Day Routine:</b> Received advice to make the exam day experience as normal as possible to reduce stress.
            Aligned daily routine with exam day events to maintain a sense of normalcy.</p> <br><br>

                            <p>Our app will let users keep track of the inventory and pricing of various goods. Our users will be small businesses in distribution/wholesail/retail space. Our app will sync the pricing and inventory data from the source itself. We will measure the effectiveness by observing five different businesses using our app for 5 days. We will also observe how they work without our app for five days.</p>

                            <li>My initial foray into UX case studies provided a wealth of learning opportunities, particularly in research methodologies.</li>
                            <li>The Google UX course offered an extensive overview of essential tools, such as Figma, which I became proficient in.</li>
                            <li>Achieving the ideal design is an ongoing journey, yet with meticulous planning and strategic approaches, the process can be significantly streamlined.</li>
