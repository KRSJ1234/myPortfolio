                    Originally from Kerala, India, I've pursued a dynamic career in technology and innovation, culminating in my current role as a Software Engineer at Cisco Systems. My educational background includes a Bachelor's in Electronics and Electrical Engineering with a minor in Product Design from IIT Guwahati, a foundation that has been instrumental in my professional growth, encompassing computer networking, backend distributed systems engineering, digital electrical system design, artificial intelligence, and UX/UI development.

                <p>
                    Beyond my technical pursuits, I am a passionate basketball player, having competed in state and national tournaments, and an avid reader with interests ranging from history to non-fiction. My formative years in the National Cadet Corps instilled in me a strong sense of discipline and values. My creativity and love for design in various forms have now led me to transition into product design, marking a new and exciting phase in my career since 2023.

                <!-- <p>
                    Hailing from the verdant state of Kerala, known as God's Own Country, my journey in technology and innovation has led me to Cisco Systems. I graduated from IIT Guwahati with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering and a minor in Product Design. This foundational education paved the way for my current role as a Software Engineer, where I delve into computer networking and backend distributed systems engineering. My work at Cisco is the culmination of a diverse range of experiences, extending beyond software engineering to digital electrical system design, artificial intelligence, and UX/UI development, skills honed through college, internships, and personal projects.

                  <p>
                    My approach is hands-on and explorative, driven by a belief in finding solutions to every challenge. This mindset has been instrumental in both my professional endeavors at Cisco and my pursuits outside of work. In the realm of sports, basketball is my passion. As a point guard, I have represented my school and college in state and national tournaments and currently play for the Cisco Corporate team and St. Raphael’s Basketball Club in my hometown.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    A fervent reader since my school days, I enjoy delving into history and non-fiction, with occasional forays into fiction for relaxation. My early years in the National Cadet Corps have also played a significant role, shaping the values and discipline that guide me today.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    As a concluding thought, my deep affinity for design in all its forms – whether it's software design, logo creation, or devising a play for a basketball possession – has always driven me to think creatively and outside the box. So, I have decided to transition into a product designer to move more closely to designing stuff. 2023 marked the beginning of this transition, and it has been an exhilarating journey so far.
