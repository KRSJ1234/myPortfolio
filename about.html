                <h2>Welcome to my little nook of the Internet!</h2>

                <p><strong>Hailing from Kerala, India</strong> the land fondly known as "God’s Own Country," I've cultivated a multifaceted career that mirrors the vibrancy of my homeland. I'm currently flexing my tech muscles as a <strong>software engineer at Cisco Systems</strong>, where the world of zeros and ones meets creativity and innovation.</p>
                <p>My love for design is not just a passion; it's a mission. I'm on a quest to harness <strong>design, creativity, and tech prowess</strong> to revolutionize healthcare sector. It's not just a job; it's a calling to make the world a little better, one pixel at a time.</p>
                
                <h3>My Academic $ Professional Journey</h3>
                <p>Armed with a <strong>Bachelor's in Electronics and Electrical Engineering</strong>, my work landscape is as diverse as it gets! From digital electrical system design to AI, graphic design, UX research, and web development – I've dabbled in it all. My mantra? Try first, judge later. This hands-on approach, fueled by a minor in Product Design, empowers me to blend user-centric thinking with even the most intricate backend solutions.</p>

                <h3>Life Beyond Code</h3>
                <p>Sports have always been a passion of mine. Growing up, cricket and volleyball were my go-to games. At 15, I discovered <strong>basketball</strong> and instantly fell in love with it. I've competed in state and national tournaments, and currently, I'm the point guard for both the <strong>Cisco Corporate team</strong> and <strong>St. Raphael's Basketball Club</strong>. My favorite team is the Dallas Mavericks. Kyrie Irving, my childhood hero and favorite player, joining the Mavs was a dream come true and a moment of sheer excitement for me. I also admire the playstyles of Tyrese Haliburton, Nikola Jokic, Luka Doncic, and Kyrie Irving.</p>
