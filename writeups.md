“Under constant dilemma: Cost vs proper treatment and diagnostic tests”

In India, people have a notion that more modicines or more diagnostic tests mean the doctor is not good or the doctor is greedy and gets paid by the pharma companies and labs to do this. This might be true, aided by some standalone incidents recently, mass media has instilled this doubt in people's minds. The ramifications of this is widespread. If a doctor wants some additional tests to conclude the diagnosis, he is scared to do so because if the patient gets a feeling that the doctor is greedy or something, the review spreads like a wildfire. The doctor might not get patients at all. This can impact his livelihood. Sometimes these doctors are forced to go with the gut feeling rather than relying heavily on test evidences. This is mostly reported by doctors of slightly younger age.
It is particularly interesting to note that the slightly experienced doctors did not came across this problem at the beginning of their career as people did not have much options and even if doctor suggests diagnostic tests or more medicines, people did not have other options due to less number of doctors, no online medical knowledge access etc. They learned all these things via experience. These doctors are experienced enough nowadays that they dont need additional tests or medicines to root cause the issue and advise medicines.
There should be proper education to patients to let them know that more tests or more medicines does not mean the doctor is bad.



Problem #2
“Scared of physical abuse from dissatisfied and angry patients/bystanders”
Trivandrum incident

Doctors expressed this concern unanimously. While its understandable that the patients/bystanders are frustrated, scared and concerned about their situation and if their expectations are not met, they do not have any right to physically assault the healthcare workers. The staff is already overworked and everyone is trying their best. This was evident in our visits to these hospitals as we saw each and everyone of the doctors, nurses and staff are working to their limit to cater the people.



Problem #3
“We feel like we are severely overworked and underpaid. Also Huge mental stress and there is no concept of rest or proper sleep or Paid Time off”
Some of us had to take 48 hour duty cycles and things are even worse for some of the surgeons. The money doctors/nurses make compared to other professionals when taking the amount of work they do is insignificant. As a result, doctors are compelled to move away from India. As a result, the number of doctors or nurses trying to go abroad has increased tremendously in India. Additionally there is no notion of the "Paid Time Off" concept. If a software engineer gets a call outside his office hour related to call, he can afford to skip the work as it is outside the work hours. But if doctors do that, society just rips them apart. They do understand that its their duty to help people irrespective of time and knew this even before getting into this line of work. But demands a little more respect and courtesy towards doctors and other healthcare professionals



Problem #4
“We are under constant pressure from society to live a certain lifestyle”
Doctors have a certain societal status in our community. They are well respected and are often seen having a great financial status also. But young doctors have told us that they have an increased expectation from society in the way they dress, the gadgets they use, the cars they drive, the houses they live in anf the lifestyles they lead. This is putting extra burden on doctors physically or mentally. People are forced to leave to other countries facing all the hardships just to earn better. Nurses too.



Problem #5
“We would like to update our knowledge on the field, but just can’t”
This should be read along with the overwork point. Young upcoming doctors are overworked and stressed too much that they do not get time to wind down. They do not get time to learn anything from their fields. Also couple of doctors said that they were worried about investments and marriage, so will have to work towards earning well also. This prevents them from reading more and working towards a better career.



Problem #6
“Patients never come for follow-up visits”
This is supported by our survey above with patients. Most of the patients do not come for follow up visits. The following is a scenario highlighted by Dr. Sneha of Pariyaram Medical college: Suppose a patient visits a doctor. Doctor diagnosed the issue and prescribed some medicines to him. Now there are two scenarios. Lets say the patient got better. Now from patient's perspective, why  he/she should go through all the hassles, wait in line for hours and go and visit the doctor again to say he got better. Now in the other scenario, lets say the patient did not get better. He simply thinks the doctor is not good and just goes to a different doctor. There is no feedback to the first doctor at all. How does he know if his treatment was effective? There is no learning opportunity at all here. 
There should a proper digital followup system or continuation of care. If patients do not want to visit the doctor back, atleast they should be able to enter their details in some mHealth app in a very user friendly way



Problem #7
“Sometimes patients go for alternative medicines or no treatment at all”
This is particularly true for patients from poor economic background or patients who dont have easy healthcare access. Every minute they spend on travelling, waiting in line, meeting doctors is lost money. So unless the symptoms are absolutely bad to the point they cant work or even standup, people do not visit the hospital. Now problem is these people, when their diseases are at the worst, visits hospital. If it is beyond curable, the blame mostly goes to the doctors or staff trying to treat them. Another problem is people directly go to alternative medicines like homeo, yunani or in some cases people do some pooja (ceremony) to cure their disease. When things go wrong, they finally approaches allopathy. Doctors also reported cases where the people go for alternative treatment methods along with allopathic treatment and if things get better, the credit goes to the alternative stuff they did. This spreads via word of mouth and more and more people come in.






Problem #8
“Since the advent of superspeciality divisions, we only get petty cases to learn from”
This is a very recent problem. All of the housesurgeons and residents learn a lot from the patients being admitted to the hospital. Generally higher the number of patients, the better doctors get at what they do. Since these superspecialities came in, people depend on these for even minor of problems. This has caused patients with different diseases to come in normal medical colleges and doctors dont get familiarized with these diseases.



Problem #9
“Huge competition for NEET PG and INICET”
The number of Post Graduation seats are very limited in India. And people are willing to spend years trying again and again to get a seat. This puts an enormous pressure on doctors to take break and study exclusively for years sometimes for these exams. The pressure this is causing the doctors are also extreme. 
It is evident that we need more doctors. We need more PG seats. We need more medical colleges.


Problem #10
“House-surgency (internship) and first year PG are absolute nightmares, Senior doctors treating as bad and reluctant to break the status quo "
Junior doctors are treated like absolute slaves here. People are absolutely exhausted all the time. The problem is, when doctors are so physically exhausted, the chances of them making the mistakes are too high. When complaints are raised to senior doctors, the response is mostly similar. That they also went through the same stuff. Why cant the junior doctors go through it too.

Some doctors even mentioned of being doing petty works for seniors like going grocery shopping etc. It is sad to see our doctors suffering like this.

Problem #11
"Patients affect the decision making by implying the diagnosis from their own research"
As everyone has smartphones, whenever people get some symptoms, they just immediately google about it and learn about it before visiting doctors. The problem is instead of explaining the symptoms, sometimes patients refer to the diagnosis directly (the one they think they have). This does not affect usually but doctors reported that when they are tired or something, this kinda induces a tunnel vision and doctors tend to think along those lines rather than thinking comprehensively.
